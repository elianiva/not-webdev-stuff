# Not Web Development Stuff

oh wow for once i learn something that isn't related to web development or mobile apps

this repo serves as my dumping ground for all machine learning related stuff
and other things that is related, experiments, and wahtnot

i'm planning on doing a lot of this in the future since i want to shift into doing ml related stuff, maybe, idk

nothing interesting to see here
